# hexGen
This app is a JavaScript program that generates a random hex code and uses it to update the background color of the webpage.

It also determines the contrast of the new background color and updates the text and button colors accordingly to ensure readability. The app uses various functions to perform different tasks, such as generating a hex code, converting it to an RGB value, calculating the contrast, and updating the background color and text/button colors. 

Users can click a button to trigger the change of background and text/button colors.

NOTE: Credit should be given to the W3C's AERT document for providing the formulas used to determine color contrast and for promoting the importance of accessibility in web design. https://www.w3.org/TR/AERT/#color-contrast
